Welcome to this workshop on personal productivity.  
Over the next few minutes, we will discuss some of the most effective techniques to manage your time, reduce procrastination, and improve focus.  
One of the first things to remember is that productivity is not about doing more, but about doing the right things at the right time.  
A good starting point is to plan your day in advance. Write down the top three tasks that matter the most, and focus on completing them first.  
Another important technique is the Pomodoro method. This involves working in focused intervals of 25 minutes, followed by a short 5-minute break.  
After four rounds, take a longer 15-30 minute break to recharge.  
Finally, remember that productivity is not about being busy, but about making consistent progress toward your goals.  
Thank you for listening, and I hope you find these tips useful!
